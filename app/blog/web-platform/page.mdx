One of the first technology decisions you need to make in a non-profit is what technology to use for your web presence. To make that decision, you need to think about why you are creating the web presence in the first place.

## purpose

1. Inform people of who you are and what you do (like a brochure)
2. Educate people about a topic you care about
3. Engage people in a discussion about those topics
4. Attract the attention of potential clients, volunteers, and donors
5. Build a relationship with clients, volunteers, and donors
6. Sell services, or help people apply for services
7. Help staff and volunteers deliver services
8. Directly deliver some services via the web

If you just want to inform people about who you are and how they can contact you, then you might be able to get away with a simple social media page. But as you start moving down the list above into more sophisticated requirements, you likely want your own website with a catchy domain name that is easy for people to find via search engines like Google. You may want to also do regular posts to various social media accounts that may attract additional attention and drive more traffic to your site.

There are lots of great platforms out there for helping non-programmers to create good looking websites for communicating information outwards and collecting some information like signing up for a periodic email. If this is all you need, then here are some sites than can help you evaluate the various platforms and decide which one is right for you.

However, as your requirements grow, you are likely going to need to move to a platform that gives you much more flexibiltiy and better performance than these non-programmer tools..... < explain why I chose Next.js >
