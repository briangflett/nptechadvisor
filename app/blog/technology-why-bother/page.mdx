There is a massive digital transformation happening around the world. It is impacting how we consume our entertainment, shop for new things, plan our vacations, and educate ourselves and our children. The for-profit sector is investing heavily in technology to reach more customers, deliver their products and services more efficiently, and improve the effectiveness of their entire operations. And yet the Canadian non-profit sector is investing less than half as much as the for-profit sector in technology. Is this because our people centered business model is just not suited to these new technologies, or do we just need some help in imagining how these technologies might help us accomplish our top day to day priorities.

Leveraging technology can significantly impact some of the top priorities for Canadian non-profits. It can help

    * attract more clients
    * raise more funds
    * increase your capacity to deliver
    * engage with staff and volunteers
    * scale for future growth

# Attract more clients

    How do the people you serve find out about you?    In Canada more than one quarter of people spend 20 hours or more on the internet for personal use.  Is your website optimized for people searching for your services?  Are you active on the social media sites your potential clients use most?  How well are you leveraging the stats generated from your website traffic to optimize your messaging and create a more informative and compelling experience?  Did you know that many of the technologies for advertising and optimizing your web presence are free for non-profits (for example, [Google Ad Grants](https://www.google.com/grants/))?

# Raise more funds

    How do potential donors find out about you?  How well are you managing your relationships with your existing contacts?  Do you know the most effective timing and messaging when asking for donations?  Can donors give electronically?  Does your website give them confidence that their credit card information will be managed securely?  Even if you are not ready for a full donor management system yet, you can start with a simple spreadsheet and a structured approach for managing your valuable donor data.

    And what about grants?  Are you investigating all potential sources of funding?  Major grant organizations are going to expect you to be able to prove the effectiveness of the services you offer.  Do you have an outcome measurement system in place following a standard like the [Common Approach](https://www.commonapproach.org/) or [CPA Approach](https://www.cpacanada.ca/business-and-accounting-resources/strategy-risk-and-governance/not-for-profit-governance/publications/performance-measurement-for-nfpos)?  Do you have a financial management system in place to prove you are a good steward of the funds you receive?  Again, you may be able to start with a spreadsheet and structured approach and then grow into a full system as the complexity and data volume warrant it.

# Increase your capacity to deliver

    Outcome measurement isn't just about justifying grant applications.  It is a basic tenant of good management.  Are you collecting data and managing it in a way that you can make data driven decisions on how to run your non-profit?  These decisions ensure you are making the most effective use of the staff and volunteer resources you have available to you to maximize the impact you are having on the social issue you are trying to address.  Technology can help not only with the decision support system, but also to drive the internal productivity of your staff and volunteers.

# Engage with staff and volunteers

    Technology is the primary driver of productivity.  In industry after industry the number of employees required to generate the same amount of output has dramatically reduced through the application of technology.  Sometimes in for-profit businesses employees see technology as a threat to their jobs.  But in the non-profit industry our biggest challenge is the lack of resources to meet the demand we know is out there for our services.  Staff and volunteers in the non-profit sector should relish the opportunity to learn and leverage technology to dramatically increase the service level they can provide with existing levels of staffing and volunteers.  Properly trained, colleagues of all ages can learn to adopt and leverage technology to increase the impact of the hours they are investing in furthering the cause of your organization.  It can also help attract the next generation of young and motivated staff and volunteers who just expect a base level of technical literacy in the organizations they engage with.

# Scale for future growth

    Do you aspire to grow your organization and increase your social impact?  Forward thinking managers put the systems in place today that set themselves up for significant growth in the future.  Current systems need to be cost effective based on your current funding stream, but you should structure them with future growth in mind.  Someone should be keeping an eye on the latest technology developments supporting the non-profit industry, and thinking about how and when they could be applied to your organization.  Understanding the technology landscape, your current level of technical capability, and having a roadmap for improving your organization's capabilities over time will ensure you are positioning your organization to drive growth rather than just react to the current issue of the day.

We have volunteers who have extensive experience in technology and want to give back by applying that knowledge to the non-profit sector. If you would like a better understanding of the technology landscape, how you compare with your non-profit peers, and how you might leverage technology to improve in these areas and more, please contact us to arrange for a free technology assessment.
